		<h1>Welcome to Georgia Southern University!</h1><br/>
		<p>
			As you travel up Georgia Southern’s scenic entrance, Southern Drive, you’ll discover the University’s rich visual history which began in 1906 among the stately Georgian architecture and the grand trees along Sweetheart Circle. I’m honored to be a part of that history, both as the new interim president of Georgia Southern, as well as the first woman in its 110 years to serve in this role.
			While our history has moved beyond the campus’ legacy heart, now sprawling over more than 900 acres and growing in enrollment, facilities and prominence, one thing has remained constant through it all: our devotion and dedication to our students. From our distinguished professors, academic advisors and support staff, Georgia Southern has created a culture of academic family, where students know they have access and support when they need it. It is this commitment to student success that drives us forward, moving us into new possibilities for learning, research, and service.
			It is the quest for student success that underpins Georgia Southern’s world-class academic environment. Our students have access to cutting-edge classrooms, laboratories, and technology, all of which provide a foundation for them to transform possibilities into reality. They are supported and taught by a world-class faculty, many of whom lead in groundbreaking teaching innovation and research, shining a national light on the University through their work. And, because of our culture of mentorship at Georgia Southern, our students — undergraduates, graduates and post-graduates alike — receive the hands-on experience that prepare them to enter the careers that ignite their passions.
			Outside the classroom, our students have access to rich and exciting opportunities. Through more than 200 student organizations, world of service projects and local, state, and national opportunities, students learn how to make a difference in the world while they grow, both personally and professionally. Georgia Southern’s campus community is alive and fueled by many opportunities for athletic competition, social interaction, recreation and engagement. Our student athletes participate at the highest level of competition through our membership in the FBS Sun Belt Conference. We compete with acclaimed success against nationally ranked opponents in a wide range of sports. In fact, our ranked football team won the 2015 Sun Belt Conference Championship, undefeated by conference opponents. But most importantly, our student athletes demonstrate their excellence in the classroom as well as on the field, with 223 of our student-athletes achieving academic honors this past year. And, all of our students enjoy our state-of-the-art Bruce and Kathryn Grube Recreation Activity Center which provides a wide range of activities and adventure for students wanting to connect with others or pursue their fitness goals.
			In everything we do, Georgia Southern University keeps the goal of student success as its true North. We are committed to helping all of our students reach their personal education goals in the classroom, while providing engaging life experiences designed to help each student to a rich, productive, and fulfilling career. At Georgia Southern, student success is not just about earning a degree, it’s about creating a successful life.
			For me, as President of this remarkable place called Georgia Southern University, there is no greater joy than seeing students join us with notions of the possible and leaving us having fashioned their dreams into reality. We welcome all to the Georgia Southern family and Eagle Nation!
